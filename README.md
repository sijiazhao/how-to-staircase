This is a JavaScript code for Adaptive Staircase Thresholding Procedure. You can find more details about this procedure in our paper [Zhao S, Brown C, Holt L, Dick F. Online tests yield robust thresholds with the right auditory hygiene LINK WILL BE AVAILABLE LATER](https://sijiazhao.github.io/how-to-staircase/).

# Try it first!
[Start your first thresholding test online here!](https://run.pavlovia.org/sijiazhao/threshold_demo)
This is just a demo described in our paper and no data is saved.

The demo was developed in PsychoPy and with some additional in-house code included here.

# How to use this
You need some basic knowledge of JavaScript to understand and use the code. 

If you want to add it to [Pavlovia] (https://pavlovia.org/), it is very easy. There will be a separate step-by-step guide about how to add the staircase into your PsychoPy study for you, using code component. For now, if you need help with Pavlovia, please contact Sijia Zhao via email.

If you feel comfortable with JavaScript, see [HERE for more details](https://sijiazhao.github.io/how-to-staircase/class).
