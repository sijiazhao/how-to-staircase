This is a JavaScript code for Adaptive Staircase Thresholding Procedure. You can find more details about this procedure in our paper [Zhao et al. Online tests yield robust thresholds with the right auditory hygiene.]

# How to use this
You need some basic knowledge of JavaScript to understand and use the code. 

If you want to add it to Pavlovia, it is very easy. There will be a separate step-by-step guide about how to add the staircase into your PsychoPy study for you, using code component. For now, if you need help with Pavlovia, please contact Sijia Zhao via email.

If you feel comfortable with JavaScript, see HERE for more details.
